What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	A hidden directory is created which will store the information about
	versions, the history. To initializa the repository and to have a
	version control.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area has the files we are going to commit, the working
	directory has the files we are working on and the repository has
	the files we are committed. The staging area provides an
	intermediate area to have more control over what we are going to
	commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	Using git diff we can see the differences between files in working
	directory and staging area, so we see how much changes are made.
