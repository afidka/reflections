What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	A hidden directory is created which will store the information about
	versions, the history. To initializa the repository and to have a
	version control.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area has the files we are going to commit, the working
	directory has the files we are working on and the repository has
	the files we are committed. The staging area provides an
	intermediate area to have more control over what we are going to
	commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	Using git diff we can see the differences between files in working
	directory and staging area, so we see how much changes are made.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history 
organized? How would branches help?
	When we are implementing a new feature but we are not sure about
	to add it to our project. We can add a new branch for working on 
	the new feature without affecting the main project in the master
	branch.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	With the diagrams we can see the branches, where they started
	and how many commits have.
