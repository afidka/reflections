When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  To let other people contribute to the project or when I'm not working on my computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	If I have some features o pieces of code I'm working on and don't want to share yet,
	I want to decide when the new additions will be accessible to everywhere.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one 
instead of another?
	Fork is for clone a repository in GitHub.
	Clone is for clone a repository that is in GitHub to my computer or to clone a
	repository that is already in my computer.
	Branches are for work on new features or code that I don't want to be in the master
	branch yet. It's only suitable for a repository.
