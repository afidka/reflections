When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  To let other people contribute to the project or when I'm not working on my computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	If I have some features o pieces of code I'm working on and don't want to share yet,
	I want to decide when the new additions will be accessible to everywhere.
